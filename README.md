### To run our site:

Horuku information where the page is hosted or however that works.

### ### WTF is WTF?

A search page with autocomplete which gives a country's national dish when submitted.

Gif of some food?

After a little team deliberation we decided to use countries as a data set - as it is small enough to quickly create the key value object ourselves and avoid making api calls to a live database.

We got to designing the architecture and file structure...

### Goals this week:
* Make A website that enables users to quickly find and select words from a list of suggestions, as they type. ✅
* The list is dynamically generated from a pre-populated list of values, leveraging searching and filtering. ✅
* A large data file is required to search through - consider the best data structure for this (we chose an object of key: value pairs). ✅
* Consider how implementation affects user experience and web performance (e.g. time to load and search through the data file). ✅

---

### Stretch goals this week:
* Allow the form submit button to return the national dish related to the country searched.
* Highlight the untyped parts of the suggestions in list
* Account for entering on the form before there is a full country in the input bar.
* Allow further functionality (maybe google or recipe search on the dish found).
* Utilise good UI practice from this week's design burst.
* Add randomiser

---

### Get the server going

* Basic functionality using node and accounting for linked files
* Modular file structure - server.js, router.js, handler.js

---

### Work out what the API should actually do!

* Be called on each keypress.
* Send the _search URL_ through the server to our data file and bring back an array of filtered data.
* Call a function to append the autofill suggestions to the DOM.
